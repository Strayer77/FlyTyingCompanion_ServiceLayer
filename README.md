# Fly Tying Companion Service Layer
## This project contains all files related to development of the service and database for the Fly Tying Companion application.

The Fly Tying Companion is an app that assists fly fisherman/fly-tyers by allowing them to quickly see what flies they can tie based off the materials they've selected in the app. The app will allow a user to create a profile, punch in materials they own, the app will then return the flies they can tie based on the inputs they made.
